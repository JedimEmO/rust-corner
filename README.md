# Mathias' Rust Corner Companion Repo

This repository contains code examples and some test challenges related to the ["Mathias' Rust Corner" YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJKQJ8J7dxNpLL5VlQUrkOJuY40qJxSk-).

To play along, go to the folder of the video you are interested in (they are located under videos/), and type `cargo run`.

Most of the videos has some example code accessible from running the binary.
They usually also have a set of tests that you can challenge yourself with.

To get help running the tests, check the output from running the example.
